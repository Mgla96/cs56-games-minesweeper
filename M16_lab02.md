<h2>(a) (20pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I’m looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.</h2>
      <p>This program executes the minesweeper game through either gui or text, where the player attempts to flag all of the locations with bombs hidden in them. Once the game is started it can be paused, quit, or reset. </p><br>


<h2>(b) (20 pts) A set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.</h2>
	<p>In the current state, the gui version is operational. Upon execution, it opens a start menu with options to play the game.</p><br>
	<p>The text version of the game is fully functional, but it may be able to be tweaked to speed up the pace of the game a little bit.</p><br>


<h2>(c) (20pts) A brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does.</h2>
	<p>Both versions of the program run and execute. The gui version of the program opens with a start menu where the user chooses a difficulty level, load previous game, or the help option. The harder difficulty levels have a larger minefield and more bombs for the user to find. The text version however is fully operational. Upon execution, it prints a 10x10 grid of question marks that are all covering either a blank space, a number representing the amount of bombs that are surrounding it, or a bomb. It is very slow and hard to play because the user has to choose an action, then choose the cell location every single time. </p>


<h2>(d) (20 pts) A set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.</h2>
	<p>As a user, it would be more entertaining and immersive to have a high score feature. This high score would be entirely dependent upon the time it takes for the user to complete the field.</p><br>
	<p>To allow for a faster interface a feature can be added where if a revealed number already has the appropriate amount of flags surrounding it, then clicking the cell with that number will uncover any remaining unrevealed cells surrounding it. This makes it so that the user does not have to manually reveal each box one-by-one. Improve start menu with title and new button layout. TextGame.java’s most recent commit comment says “added different difficulties,” but upon running the terminal version of the game there is no option to choose a different difficulty level. Instead, it loads a default grid/minefield size of 10 by 10. </p><br>
	<p>Within the terminal version of the game, more verbose usage errors would be helpful.</p><br>


<h2>(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?</h2>
	<p>README.md file contains high level description of project, links to migration source and previous code from W14, as well as notes by the developer and W16 group.</p><br>
	<p>Information provided by W16 group could have been more specific as to how the two styles they worked with differed, as well as what changes they made in terms of style. </p><br>


<h2>(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).</h2>
	<p>The build.xml file already contains a description for each target. Not entirely sure if the clean target works.</p><br>


<h2>(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current <q>issues</q>. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?</h2>
	<p>… There are currently four issues posted to the original repo that add up to a total of 850 points.</p><br>
	<p>All of the issues are fairly direct in expectation. Issues 11 and 12 appear to be the most open ended as they refer to <q>change the test cases</q>. The other two are very clear, however.</p><br>

<h2>(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough..</h2>
	<p>We have not discovered any additional issues so far.</p><br>

<h2>(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just <q>one screenful of text</q> to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?</h2>
	<p>Class names and initial commented descriptions could be more clear in representing its role in program. Some names such as GUIGame.java are confusing because its description says it makes the game on the terminal function.</p><br>
	<p>Code is structured decently well with regards to readability, certain files definitely have more comments and explanation.</p><br>
	<p>In one screen of text, we would explain the two different game types, cmd line and GUI versions. In this explanation, we would categorize each of the class implementations as either cmd, GUI, or both, and show how it is essential to its respective game type. Test functionality definitely needs to be touched upon, acknowledging the purpose of each test, as well as the incompleteness of certain tests.</p><br> 
	

<h2>(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?</h2>
	<p>There are a handful of test cases without any code in them, just a comment explaining the reason why that particular case could not be tested.</p><br>
	<p>At the current state there is only one test class and that is for the grid class.</p><br>
	<p>We can add basic test cases for the other classes to ensure that the program runs, but there is not that much room to expand the test code due to the nature of the program. Testing a GUI would be included in the running the program with different user inputs. It would be inefficient to write all of those different possibilities out in a test class.<p></br>
