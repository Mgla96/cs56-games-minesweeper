Kate Perkins and Ryan Wiener

1. A minesweeper game that has both a text and GUI interface

2.
* As a CUI I can run the text game in the shell
* As a GUI I can run the game in a window on my screen
* As a user I can choose a game difficulty
* As a user I can read the leaderboards

3. Yes the software runs allowing to play minesweeper in the shell or in a graphical window

4.
* Asking for winner's name after game is complete rather than at the main menu
* Adding images to the GUI implementation of the game
* Refresh the grid in the terminal instead of reprinting it
* Improve the color scheme
* Prompt first-time users with instructions screen

5. Everything seems good but those equal signs before titles

6. Add a target to build a jar file for the text and GUI versions of the game

7. Yes the issues are clear, but there are only 600 points worth of issues

8. 
* [Main menu layout](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/49 "Issue #49")
* [Leaderboard](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/48 "Issue #48")
* [isGui in Grid.java](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/47 "Issue #47")
* [GUIGame.java is pointless](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-minesweeper/issues/51 "Issue #51")

9. 
* Both test and regular class files are located in one folder. We'd like to separate them into separate folders so that they are easier to find. 
* The GUIGame.java class isn't used. The GUI version uses MineGUI.java class and the text version uses TextGame.java. 
* We noticed some variables that seemed unnecessary to the functionality of the application. 
    * In MineGUI.java, they use a variable size that simply assigned the size of the public Grid game. 
    * In Grid.java, there is a private boolean isGUI. We don't see the point.  
* With the exception of GUIGame.java, the relationship between the classes make sense. 
* The code is easy to read and understand
* Grid.java is the games logic class. HelpScreen.java, MineComponent.java, and MineGUI.java classes are basically the classes that control the user interface of the GUI game. The TextGui.java class control the text game.

10. There are two test classes GUITest.java and GridTest.java. 
* The GridTest.java class looks well tests and covers the important methods in Grid.java class. 
* The GUITest.java class is very empty. It doesn't seem to have completely covered all methods. We will expand the GUITest.java class to cover all methods.
