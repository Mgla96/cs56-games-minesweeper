1. this is minesweeper. It can be played through both a GUI and from the command line window.

2. As a user I can start a game with varying difficulty. As a user i can save the status of the game as well as load a game which was previously saved. I can also pause the game, or reset the game. 

3. The game is in good overall condition, and runs with minimal bugs related to the user. The software creates a GUI interface for the user to interact with. The game is also playable through the terminal, which is started from another class. There are three main classes which handle the bulk of the work. One which focuses primarily on the underlying grid structure of the game, one class for each object in the grid structure, and a class which implements both into a GUI/Text interface.

4. The game would be better if the music was more developed. Background music or higher quality sound effects would make the game more polished and professional. 

5. The README.md is in good quality but only provides a brief summary of the game, and does not provide enough technical details about the source files.

6. The build.xml is working but there are no target descriptions. These need to be added and could be done for 100 points.

7. Yes there is a good list of issues on the game. There are just enough for 1000 points, although there are some developments which could be added for more project points, such as updating the build.xml.

8. n/a. We may add more issues if/when they come.

9. The code is mostly split into three main classes, MineComponent, MineGUI, and Grid. Not all the functions have function descriptions on them, which could be added for project points. Furthermore, the variables which are declared do not have great descriptions for their uses and functionalities. The code was hard to understand at first, and it's not apparently obvious how the classes relate to each other. However everything is working and the code within the classes is structured neatly.

10. There is a JUnit test for the Grid class. This class has a good amount of JUnit tests and covers many cases for the Grid class. However, there are no other JUnit tests written at the moment, and could be a good opportunity for project points.
